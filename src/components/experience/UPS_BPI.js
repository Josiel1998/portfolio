            <strong>Overview</strong>
            <h3>Internship with many learning opportunities!</h3>
            <div>
              The responsibilities I held in this internship was to revolve
              around the process of automating business processes through
              programming. Besides for automating a business process, my role
              included shadowing the process in its entirety to find
              opportunities for improvement, as-is and to-be (future state)
              mappings, and tracking feedback.
              <br />
              <br />
              The benefits of automating processes is that it eliminates human
              error, allows the organization to allocate resources, and requires
              minimal training to use the new automated process that is
              available at an ad-hoc request.
              <br />
              <br />A takeaway from this internship would be the impact it had
              on a process for a Pricing department. I was able to successfully
              automate a business processing from extraction, storage,
              reporting, and finally to printing. I was able to reduce the
              process total time by 91%, saving 436 hours of process total time
              in a year, and ultimately saving the business $36,000/yr. It was
              very exciting to provide an impact for a business that was
              measurable.

            <h3>Challeneges</h3>
            <div>
              Some challenges I had throughout the internship opportunity was
              being able to learn a new language like VBA. This became easier
              over time as I was able to apply my foundational knowledge of
              object-oriented programming from java. Another challenge initially
              was adjusting to a professional role, as this internship
              experience was my first exposure to a professional work setting.

            <h3>Exposure</h3>
            <div>
              The exposure I had during this opportunity was to applying my
              programming knowledge for automation, presenting to senior
              leadership, and elaborating on the benefits of automation in the
              workplace. I also received an in-depth exposure to the business of
              transporting goods via truckload and freight. I also become
              exposed to client contracts with UPS.
