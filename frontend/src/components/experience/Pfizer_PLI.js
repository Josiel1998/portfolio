            <strong>Overview</strong>
            <h3>Internship with many hats!</h3>
            <div>
              During this internship experience the Global Commercial Application
              support team had an unstructured way of communicating sales applications
              infrastructure outage communications. My role as an intern was to gather all 
              user requirements, technology requirements, management, and development of the
              solution. 

              <br />
              <br />
              I was able to use many different skills during this internship such as communicating
              with various key stakeholders to gather user requirements and understand business pain points
              to developing an application with partners across the globe!

              <br />
              <br />A takeaway from this internship would be the experience of being involved in all of the 
              Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process while playing many different to roles such as 
              the project lead, project manager, and software developer. Many aspects of the role are to think long
              term for the solution from a cost perspective - I had to evaluate the cost of purchasing SaaS software compared
              to building an in-house solution, or leveraging solutions through enterprise business solutions such as SharePoint. 
              Ultimately, due to the subscription cost of purchasing SaaS subscription and the limitation of the functionality, that technology
              solution is proven to be costly and risky due to not having ownership of the data. Another avenue that was 
              review is building a solution from the ground up which will involve high cost for the initial development and a high
              cost for maintenance. Ultimately SharePoint is a great solution due to the long-term maintenance cost of the solution
              and being able to find less expensive talent to support the platform in the future. 
              <br />
              <br /> Ultimately I presented the solution to the key stakeholders and managers. The solution will be able to 
              provide one communication that is consistent regardless if it is created by colleagues in APAC, EMEA, or AMER. 
              This internship also allowed me to branch out for other opportunities such as leading the creation of networking
              groups for more than 100 interns and being able to co-host a panel to educate interns on colleague resource groups.

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <div>
              Some challenges I had throughout the internship opportunity was 
              being able to build and develop continuous feedback during scrum meetings. 
              This was proved to be a challenge due to not having the face-to-face communication
              due to the partner being located in India. Some opportunities were network connectivity 
              and being able to be on the same page about requirements and goals.

            <h3>Exposure</h3>
            <div>
              The exposure I had during this opportunity was being able to manage the business side
              of technology and being able to manage technical assets. This was a great experience overall
              due to being exposed to different parts of what it takes to develop a solution.
