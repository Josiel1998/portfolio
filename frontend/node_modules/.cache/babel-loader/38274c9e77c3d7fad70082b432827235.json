environments</h3>\n            <div>\n              This project was an idea that was created during the inception of\n              the HackPSU MLG Hackathon. The purpose this project served was to\n              facilitate an improved learning environment with the use of\n              virtual assistance.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The idea originated from converting speech to text. Once an\n              accurate representation of the speech was converted to text, we\n              then created a bevy of actions we found useful inside of a\n              learning environment. Such actions were web searches, launching\n              applications, and even an action to lock the device. After some\n              experimentation, the program was able to complete such tasks\n              simultaneously on multiple PCs running Windows OS. I have since\n              redesigned the structure of the source code, the original code\n              involved a powershell file, java file, and a text document.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The redesign of the project allowed me to remove the PowerShell\n              file which served the purpose of scanning for a changed file. I\n              have implemented a new code in java to handle all executions for\n              the program and have allowed me to expand the functionality of the\n              code for Mac OS users. Allowing java to handle all executions\n              prevented me from creating a Bash file that would have served the\n              same role as the defunct PowerShell file.\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-3 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\">\n            <div>\n              <strong>Tech specs</strong>\n              <br />\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Windows OS</span> \n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Mac OS</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Java</span> \n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Powershell</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Bash</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">IFTTT</span>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <strong>Year</strong>\n              <br />\n              2018, 2020\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <div>\n              <strong>Event</strong>\n              <br />\n              MLG Hackathon\n            </div>\n            <br/>\n            <div>\n              <strong>Source Code</strong>\n              <br />\n              <a href=\"https://github.com/nsalomonb/AlexaIntegration/tree/master/Amazon%20Alexa%20Control%20Files\" target=\"_blank\">Original, 2018</a>\n              <br/>\n              <a href=\"https://github.com/Josiel1998/AlexaIntegration\" target=\"_blank\">Redesign, 2020</a>\n              <br/>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <div className=\"row mb-0 justify-content-center align-items-center\">\n          <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-xl-7 mb-0\">\n            <strong>In depth</strong>\n            <h3>Structure</h3>\n            <div className=\"container\">\n              <img src={structure} width=\"100%\" />\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-2 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <div className=\"row mb-0 justify-content-center align-items-center\">\n          <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-xl-7 mb-0\">\n            <strong>Opportunities</strong>\n            <h3>Challeneges and potential</h3>\n            <div>\n              Throughout collaboration of this project, there were areas for\n              opportunities and potential application of the technology. Some\n              challenges at the time was finding a cloud service that supported\n              speech-to-text conversion, at the time AWS did not have such\n              support. Another challenge was finding a way to send the speech\n              captured from Alexa to a service and then retrieving the text as a\n              user for further processing of the action.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              The potential application of this technology is for a professor,\n              teacher, or instructor to have control of a classroom where\n              computers are used. The teacher can control the applicaiton that\n              needs to be launched or lock all computers if the pupils are\n              distracted through one voice command.\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              After the redesign, an opportunity that may benefit the program is\n              by manipulating the java code with more if statements to provide\n              more flexibility with the command. At the moment, the commands are\n              created via IFTTT applets. A better approach may be by just having\n              IFTTT append the dropbox file with the targetted command\n              application and the java program executed whether the application\n              would like to be opened, closed, etc. Currently constructed if I\n              wanted to close an application two different applets would need to\n              be created on IFTTT with a different trigger command.\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-2 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <div>\n          Collaborators: Nicolas Saloman, Gabriel Ynoa, Josiel Delgadillo\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"spacer\"></div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
