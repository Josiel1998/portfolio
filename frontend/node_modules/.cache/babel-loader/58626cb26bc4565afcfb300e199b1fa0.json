Many aspects of the role are to think long\n              term for the solution from a cost perspective - I had to evaluate the cost of purchasing SaaS software compared\n              to building an in-house solution, or leveraging solutions through enterprise business solutions such as SharePoint. \n              Ultimately, due to the subscription cost of purchasing SaaS subscription and the limitation of the functionality, that technology\n              solution is proven to be costly and risky due to not having ownership of the data. Another avenue that was \n              review is building a solution from the ground up which will involve high cost for the initial development and a high\n              cost for maintenance. Ultimately SharePoint is a great solution due to the long-term maintenance cost of the solution\n              and being able to find less expensive talent to support the platform in the future. \n\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-3 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\">\n            <div>\n              <strong>Tools used</strong>\n              <br />\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">MS Access</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">SQL</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">VBA</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Javascript</span>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <strong>Year</strong>\n              <br />\n              Jan. 2018 - Aug. 2018\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <div>\n              <strong>Exposure</strong>\n              <br />\n              - Web Automation\n              <br />\n              <br />- Self taught VBA language\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <div className=\"row mb-0 justify-content-center align-items-center\">\n          <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-xl-7 mb-0\">\n            <strong>Opportunities</strong>\n            <h3>Challeneges</h3>\n            <div>\n              Some challenges I had throughout the internship opportunity was\n              being able to learn a new language like VBA.
