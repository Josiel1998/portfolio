I was able to successfully\n              automate a business processing from extraction, storage,\n              reporting, and finally to printing. I was able to reduce the\n              process total time by 91%, saving 436 hours of process total time\n              in a year, and ultimately saving the business $36,000/yr. It was\n              very exciting to provide an impact for a business that was\n              measurable.\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-3 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\">\n            <div>\n              <strong>Tools used</strong>\n              <br />\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">MS Access</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">SQL</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">VBA</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Javascript</span>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <strong>Year</strong>\n              <br />\n              Jan. 2018 - Aug. 2018\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <div>\n              <strong>Exposure</strong>\n              <br />\n              - Web Automation\n              <br />\n              <br />- Self taught VBA language\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <div className=\"row mb-0 justify-content-center align-items-center\">\n          <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-md-8 col-lg-9 col-xl-7 mb-0\">\n            <strong>Opportunities</strong>\n            <h3>Challeneges</h3>\n            <div>\n              Some challenges I had throughout the internship opportunity was\n              being able to learn a new language like VBA. This became easier\n              over time as I was able to apply my foundational knowledge of\n              object-oriented programming from java. Another challenge initially\n              was adjusting to a professional role, as this internship\n              experience was my first exposure to a professional work setting.\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <h3>Exposure</h3>\n            <div>\n              The exposure I had during this opportunity was to applying my\n              programming knowledge for automation, presenting to senior\n              leadership, and elaborating on the benefits of automation in the\n              workplace. I also received an in-depth exposure to the business of\n              transporting goods via truckload and freight. I also become\n              exposed to client contracts with UPS.\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-2 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <div></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"spacer\"></div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
