Many aspects fo the role is to think long term for the solution from a cost perspective - I had to evaluate the cost of purchasing SaaS software compared to building a in-house solution, or leveraging solutions through enterprise business solutions such as SharePoint. Ultimately, due to the subscription cost of purchasing SaaS subscription and the limitatino of the business, that technology solution is proven to be costly and risky due to not having ownership of the data. Another avenue that was review is building a solution from the ground up which will involve high cost for the initial development and a high cost for maintenance.

hats!</h3>\n            <div>\n              During this internship experience the Global Commericial Application\n              support team had an unstructured way of communicating sales applications\n              infrastrcuture outage communications. My role as an intern was to gather all \n              user requirements, technology requirements, management, and development of the\n              solution. \n              <br />\n              <br />\n              I was able to use many different skills during this internship such as communicating\n              with various key stakeholders to gather user requirements and understand business painpoints\n              to developing an application with partners across the globe!\n              <br />\n              <br />A takeaway from this internship would be the experience of being involved in all of the \n              Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) process while playing many diffferent to roles such as \n              the project lead, project manager, and software developer. Many aspects fo the role is to think long\n              term for the solution from a cost perspective - I had to evaluate the cost of purchasing SaaS software compared\n              to building a in-house solution, or leveraging solutions through enterprise business solutions such as SharePoint. \n              Ultimately, due to the subscription cost of purchasing SaaS subscription and the limitatino of the business, that technology\n              solution is proven to be costly and risky due to not having ownership of the data. Another avenue that was \n              review is building a solution from the ground up which will involve high cost for the initial development and a high\n              cost for maintenance. Ultimately SharePoint is a great solution due to the long term maintenance cost of the solution\n              and being able to find less expensive talent to support the platform in the future. \n              <br />\n              <br /> Ultimately I presented the solution to the key stakeholders and managers. The solution will be able to \n              provide one communication that is consistent regardless if it is created by colleagues in APAC, EMEA, or AMER. \n              This internship also allowed me to branch out for other opportunities such as leading the creation of networking\n              groups for more than 100 interns and being able to co-host a panel to educate interns on colleague resource groups. \n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-3 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\">\n            <div>\n              <strong>Tools used</strong>\n              <br />\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">SharePoint</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">SPFx Framework</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Typescript</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">HTML</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">CSS</span>\n              <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-primary\">Visio</span>\n              <br />\n              <br />\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <strong>Year</strong>\n              <br />\n              July 2020 - Aug. 2020\n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <div>\n              <strong>Exposure</strong>\n              <br />\n              - SDLC\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              - Self taught Typescript\n              <br />\n              <br />\n              - SharePoint Custom Web Part Development\n            </div>\n            <br />\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <div className=\"row mb-0 justify-content-center align-items-center\">\n          <div className=\"col-sm-8 col-md-7 col-lg-8 col-xl-6 mb-0\">\n            <strong>Opportunities</strong>\n            <h3>Challeneges</h3>\n            <div>\n              Some challenges I had throughout the internship opportunity was \n              being able to build and develop continuous feedback during scrum meetings. \n              This was proved to be a challeneg due to not having the face-to-face communication\n              due to the partner being located in India. Some opportunities was network connectivity \n              and being able to be on the same page about requirements and goals. \n            </div>\n            <br />\n            <h3>Exposure</h3>\n            <div>\n              The exposure I had during this opportunity was tbeing able to manage the business side\n              of technology and being able to manage technical assets. This was a great experience overall\n              due to being exposed to different parts of what it takes to develop a solution. \n          </div>\n          <div className=\"col-md-2 col-sm-4 side-block mb-0 animated fadeInUp\"></div>\n        </div>\n        <br />\n        <br />\n        <div></div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"spacer\"></div>\n    </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
