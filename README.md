This portfolio was created with HTML5, CSS, React.JS, and Bootstrap. The site used a human-centered design approach from Jakob Nielson, in specific the #4 heuristic Consistency and Standards and #8 Aesthetic and minimalist design.

The reason I used Nielson usability heuristics is that it creates a pleasant experience reading content. The combination of easy to read content and rapid page rendering with React.JS provides an excellent experience for the user.
